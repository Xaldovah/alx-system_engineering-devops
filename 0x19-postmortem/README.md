# Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Outage
## Issue Summary:
•	Duration: The outage occurred on November 8, 2023, from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM (EAT).
•	Impact: The web service experienced a 30% reduction in response time, affecting approximately 15% of users. Users reported slow page loading and intermittent connectivity issues.
Timeline:
•	Issue Detection: The problem was initially detected at 10:00 AM through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in response times.
•	Detection Method: Our monitoring system triggered an alert based on increased response times beyond the defined thresholds.
•	Actions Taken:
•	Investigation: The engineering team immediately began investigating the issue, focusing on the web server and database components.
•	Assumptions: Initial assumptions pointed to a potential database bottleneck due to increased traffic.
•	Misleading Paths:
•	A misleading investigation path was taken as the team initially suspected a database query optimization issue.
•	Additional time was spent investigating network latency, which did not contribute to the root cause.
•	Escalation:
•	The incident was escalated to the DevOps and Database teams as the investigation pointed towards a potential database-related problem.
•	Resolution:
•	The root cause was identified as a misconfigured database connection pool, causing delays in query execution.
•	The configuration was corrected, and the database connection pool was optimized for better performance.
Root Cause and Resolution:
•	Root Cause:
•	The misconfiguration of the database connection pool led to inefficient handling of database connections, resulting in increased response times.
•	Resolution:
•	The configuration was corrected by adjusting the maximum connection pool size and optimizing connection handling.
•	Database queries were also reviewed and optimized for better efficiency.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
•	Improvements:
•	Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect anomalies in database performance.
•	Implement automated testing for database connection pool configurations.
•	Conduct regular performance audits to identify potential bottlenecks.
•	Tasks:
•	TODO: Patch Nginx Server: Ensure the web server is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
•	TODO: Add Memory Monitoring: Implement monitoring for server memory usage to detect potential issues proactively.
In conclusion, the web stack debugging outage on November 8, 2023, was swiftly addressed by identifying and rectifying a misconfiguration in the database connection pool. The incident highlighted the importance of continuous monitoring, prompt detection, and a systematic approach to debugging. Moving forward, the team will implement measures to prevent similar incidents, including enhanced monitoring, automated testing, and regular performance audits. Additionally, specific tasks such as patching the Nginx server and adding memory monitoring will be undertaken to fortify the system against potential vulnerabilities.
